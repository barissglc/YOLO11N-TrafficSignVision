## Project Summary

This project presents a model trained with the **YOLO11N** architecture to detect traffic signs. The training process includes log files, graphs, and weight files, allowing for a detailed analysis of model performance. The model weight file used is `yolo11n.pt`.

---

## Training Process

- **Model:** YOLO11N  
- **Parameters:** The hyperparameters used during training are specified in the `args.yaml` file.  
- **Logs:** Detailed training logs (`events.out.tfevents.*`) can be analyzed using tools like TensorBoard.  
- **Weights:** The final trained model weights are stored in the `weights/` directory.
